Yet-Another MVC. Compile-only; Forced (B|T)DD 


## Design Direction

Basically, I want to think about this not as a framework, or a library, but a compiler. 

Application development is split up into /tags/. Everything is a tag. Your app is a tag. your input is a tag. Your mom is a tag. (Think [BladeRunner](http://bladerunnerjs.org/2013/09/16/introducing-bladerunnerjs/))

tags are in tag folers like this.

    tag-name/
      tag-name-spec.coffee
      tag-name.coffee
      tag-name-view1/
        tag-name-view1.mustache (maybe .haml, maybe .hamlstache)
        tag-name-view2.scss
      tag-name-view2/
        tag-name-view2.haml
        tag-name-view2.scss

tags can reference other tags, (maybe link for infinite recursion, maybe limit of like, 800 gorram tags, who knows.)

tag-name.haml/.scss may contain *no* condtionals and *no* for loops. No Branching/Jumping

tag-name.scss can overwrite styles of inner tags. 

tag-name.coffee scope is completely, 100% isolated from other tags. It can communicate to a standard event bus though. (send, subscribe, publish, broadcast). No targets though, only channels. This is a compile time error otherwise. This event-bus is how it will recieve event notification from UI events, data-change notifications.

tag is compiled based on tag-name-spec. You could have 80 gorram views, but if only 2 are referenced in tag-name-spec, that's all that yer gunna get buddy. 

Each tag has lots and lots of ways to be displayed (all generated by the compiler.)

Compiler output pre-rendered/optimized (think [gwit](http://www.gwtproject.org/))

* ie6-11
* pre/post evergreen Chrome
* pre/post evergreen firefox
* iceweasel
* osx safari 1-5
* windows safari
* iphones
* ipads
* androids
* google spider

And non-web like things: (Think [metawidget](http://metawidget.org/))

* iOS app
* android app
* WPF
* swing
* opengl
* markdown
* LaTeX
* png

Each tag has lots and lots of ways to be included. Examples/docs/support infrastructure generated by compiler. Think [switcType=](http://livedemo.exadel.com/richfaces-demo/richfaces/tabPanel.jsf?c=tabPanel&tab=usage).

* ajax-data
        Q.get(xyz).then(function(data){$(xyz).template.render(data)})
* ajax-html
        Q.get(xyz).then(function(data){$(xyz).innerHTML = (data)})
* websocket-listen-data
* websocket-listen-html
* websocket-request-data
* websocket-request-html
* [big-pipe](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919)
        Q.get(xyz).then(xyz.html = data.html).then(xyz.css = data.css).then(eval(data.js))
* iframe
        $iframe.src = xyz
* re-direct
* post-back
        <form aciton="POST"></form>
* inline
* inline-separate-files 
* inline-isolated-files
